Problems in React
  It’s hard to reuse stateful logic between components 
  Complex components become hard to understand
  Classes confuse both people and machines

Hooks Solve These
  Reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy
  Split a component into smaller pieces based on what pieces are related
  Use more of React Features without classes

Hooks Conventions
  ONLY TO BE USED IN FUNCTION COMPONENTS - Don’t be that guy I saw on Reddit…
  Name always start with ’use’ 

Other Benefits
  React devs probably have access to optimizations in the framework that we don't (Other languages and frameworks do this, Java Streams for example)

Finally...
  Classes are still supported for the foreseeable future
  Hooks work side by side with existing code
  Hooks are the future of React
